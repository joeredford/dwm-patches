The dwm-5.9-fancybar.diff is an update to the fancybar patch on suckless.org
for version 5.9. The patch was also changed so that the focused window's title 
will only have its colors inverted when there is more than one window on the 
current tag. Note that this is not to be confused with the colored clickable
fancybar patch also on suckless.org.
